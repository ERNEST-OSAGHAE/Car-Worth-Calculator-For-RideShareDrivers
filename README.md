# Car-Worth-Calculator_For-RideShareDrivers
Car Asset Calculator
This application was written in python
This application is geared towards rideshare drivers (Uber, Lyft).
The application helps you calculate your car as either an asset or a liability.
It iterates through months of the year and calculate how much you have made with the car.
Whatever you have made with your car as a rideshare driver is subtracted from 3X the purchase price.
We call 3X the purchase price "Asset Value" in this application. So "3X purchase price" = "Asset Value"
